        <h1>Memory Game</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

        <h2>Memory Remembered</h2>
        <p>Invented by Charles Rutherford III in 1876, this game combined his love of memory with his passion for self aggrandisement through card tricks.  Legendary for his double bowler "round the world" back flip finish, sadly this same flourish would lead to his untimely demise in the back alley of a Shanghai brothel at the hands of the infamous "Winky the One Eyed Prostitute"  A commemorative plaque still bears his name and exploits at the base of of the Lincoln Monument to this day.</p>
